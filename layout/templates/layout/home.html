		<i class="tab">&ensp;My name is Daniel Arpide, and I'm a graduate of Wentworth Institute of Technology. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, but have always had a stronger interest in the Computer Science portion of the curriculum. In college I worked with a team to develop an application using the Spotify API, while creating this I found out that programming was the path I wanted to take in my career. I am currently a junior software engineer focusing in web development.</i>
